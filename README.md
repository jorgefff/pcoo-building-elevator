# PCOO - Building elevator system
Done for the Object Oriented Concurrent Programming course in University of Aveiro

## Usage
No args (default parameters)
```
java main -ea
```
With custom parameters
```
java main -ea <num floors> <num people> <elevator capacity> <inside priority(Y/N)> <graphical(Y/N)> <threadpool size> 
```
 
## TO-DO
 * Seperate logic from concurrency
 * Use Labyrinth class from pt.ua.gboard instead of Graphical
 * Seperate people tasks to better use threadpool capabilities
